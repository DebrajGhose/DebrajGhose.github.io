<h1>Hello</h1>

<p> My name is Debraj, and I am interested in understanding cellular behavior. My scientific philosophy is to develop mechanistic models that can be tested experimentally. I then use these theoretical models as "microscopes" to uncover biological mechanisms that might not be easily observable with available technologies. </p>

<p> Currently, I am a PhD student in the Lew Lab, where I study how eukaryotic cells sense chemical gradients. Some key aspects of my work flow are building and analyzing partial differential equation models, confocal microscopy, image analysis, and yeast genetics. </p>
