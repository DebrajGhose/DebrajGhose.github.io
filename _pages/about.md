I am a PhD student in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics program at Duke University, and work in the Lew lab. My current research is focused on understanding how yeast sense spatial chemical gradients. To uncover the mechanistic basis for gradient sensing in yeast, I utilize a combination of genetics, confocal microscopy, and simulations of partial differential equations.
