 I am a PhD student in Computational Biology at Duke University in the Lew lab.
 
 In the lab, I use the budding yeast as a model organism to study gradient tracking in eukaryotic cells. Gradient tracking refers to the ability of a cell to move (chemotaxis) or grow (chemotropism) toward or away from a chemical source.
