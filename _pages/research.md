Many eukaryotic cells can sense and respond to chemical gradients by moving or growing in a particular direction. Some examples are metastasizing cancer cells, developing neurons, *Dictyostelium*, neutrophils, and budding yeast. While much is known about how these cells can sense a given chemical and how they move or grow, the process of converting a spatial chemical gradient into directed movement or growth remains a mystery. 

Thus, to understand how single cells respond to chemical gradients, I study the mating response in the budding yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, as a model. Yeast are non-motile, but they have been shown to possess a chemosenstive patch that can migrate up gradients of yeast pheromone along the cell's cortex. Through a series of genetic manipulations, microscopy, PDE simulations, and gilespie simulations, I am trying to uncover how the yeast's chemosensitive patch senses and responds to chemical gradients.
